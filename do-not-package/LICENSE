+ do-not-package/aspell-en+en_US-wordlist.txt and en_US-w_accents_suse.multi are
  presumably used under:
  https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist/blob/master/scowl/Copyright

+ do-not-package/oxygen/* is under an unclear license.

+ do-not-package/add_context/* can be used under GPL 2 or 3, which is what
  it was licensed under as part of the https://github.com/openSUSE/suse-xsl
